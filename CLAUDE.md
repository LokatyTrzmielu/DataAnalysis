# Claude Code Instructions

## Working Guidelines

1. **Think First, Read Code**: Always think through the problem first and read the codebase for relevant files before making changes.

2. **Check Before Major Changes**: Before making any major changes, check in with the user to verify the plan.

3. **High-Level Explanations**: Every step of the way, provide a high-level explanation of what changes were made.

4. **Simplicity First**: Make every task and code change as simple as possible. Avoid massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.

5. **Maintain Documentation**: Keep a documentation file that describes how the architecture of the app works inside and out.

6. **No Speculation**: Never speculate about code you have not opened. If the user references a specific file, read it first before answering. Investigate and read relevant files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. Never make claims about code before investigating - give grounded and hallucination-free answers.
